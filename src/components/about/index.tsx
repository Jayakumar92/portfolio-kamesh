                self-proclaimed designer
              </a>
              who specializes in full stack development (React.js &amp; Node.js). I am enthusiastic about bringing the
              technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and
              writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.

              I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a
              developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early
              thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications
              using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
            </p>
            <p className="text-normal text-base">
              I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way
              to development.
